Hybrid is an atmospheric, sci-fi text-based game. You play the role of a hybrid soldier, deployed to a planet to kill the last alien queen and end the war in humanity's favour. But are your orders as simple as they appear, or is there more to this mission?

Hybrid combines the best of roguelikes and MUDs to provide high-stakes combat. Choose from a myriad of different skills and abilities, upgrade yourself, and try to survive. Can you reach the bottom and slay the queen?

Made for the Games for Blind Gamers 2023 jam. The text console works with screen-readers, such as NVDA.
